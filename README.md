### But what IS LateX?

LaTeX, which is pronounced «Lah-tech» or «Lay-tech» (to rhyme with «blech» or «Bertolt Brecht»), is a document preparation system for high-quality typesetting. It is most often used for medium-to-large technical or scientific documents but it can be used for almost any form of publishing.

LaTeX is not a word processor! Instead, LaTeX encourages authors not to worry too much about the appearance of their documents but to concentrate on getting the right content. As a matter of fact, LateX is the closest that you can get to totally distraction-free work - whether it be at a cozy coffee shop table, or at your desk at home.

You can learn more about LateX from https://www.latex-project.org/about/
